//the type of data that we store in a vaieable in java
//there are 8 types in primitive data type:


//1. byte (is use for short number. range between is -128 to 127)
//2. short (is use for more then byte number.range between is -32678 to 32767)
//3.int (is use for then short number. range between is 2 to the power -31 2 to power 31-1)
//4.long(is is use for more then Int number.range btween is 2 to the power -63 to 2 power 63-1)
//5. float is use for floating number. it use compulsary use in final ,becuse java  does not recognise it as as a flaot, it recognise
//6.double (it also use for floating numbers. in large Amount)
//7.boolean (is use for true or false value )
//8.char (is use for a single alphabet ,and contain in single inversted coma )
